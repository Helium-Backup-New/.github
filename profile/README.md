## Helium Backup Crack

Helium Backup 1.1.4 is a popular Android app for backing up and restoring data without requiring root access. It allows users to back up their apps, app data, contacts, messages, call logs, and media (photos, videos) to cloud storage services or local storage. Helium supports both manual and automated backups, and it can back up data to a computer or external storage device. The app offers a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to manage their backups. Helium Backup is particularly useful for users who want to migrate to a new device or restore data after a factory reset. Although it doesn’t require root access, some advanced features may need additional setup or a desktop companion application.
